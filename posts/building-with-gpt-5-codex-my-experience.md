Over the past few weeks, I’ve been experimenting with GPT-5 Codex to build small websites. What started as crude wireframes in Apple Notes quickly became polished 11ty projects with clean layouts and modern styling — all with surprisingly little effort on my part.

From a lost & found pet site to a birthday page and even a simple encryption toolkit, the process felt conversational and fast. GPT-5 Codex handled the tedious details while I focused on the big picture, making the whole experience both fun and a glimpse into the future of programming.

## Introduction

I’ve been experimenting with GPT-5 Codex to build small, single-page websites. While I’ve shared an overview of how smoothly the process went, here I want to dive deeper: not just *that* it worked, but *what it felt like* to work this way, what surprised me, and what I learned along the way.

## Why Small Projects?

I like building tiny, focused projects — little experiments that can be finished in a weekend. They’re quick, they’re playful, and they give me something tangible to share. But what usually slows me down is the tedious glue work: styling, repetitive edits, or restructuring when I change my mind. That’s where GPT-5 Codex came in and made the whole process lighter.

## The Workflow: Conversational and Iterative

The process felt more like a conversation than traditional coding. I’d sketch a rough idea in Apple Notes, hand it over, and Codex would spin up a working site in minutes. Then we’d go back and forth: I’d highlight gaps, it would adjust, and we’d iterate. What struck me wasn’t just the speed, but how I could stay in the role of planner and designer while Codex handled the details.

## Handling Tedious Changes

One of the best moments was asking Codex to transform my private “lost pet” site (originally about my cat, Luna) into a more general “lost & found pet” site. Normally, renaming everything, stripping private info, and making it public-ready is a slog. Codex did 95% of that work in one sweep, leaving me to fine-tune only the last little bits.

## Project Showcase

### 🐾 Lost & Found Pet Website

Started as a personal tool for my own cat, Luna. With Codex’s help, it quickly became a polished, shareable template for anyone who needs a lost pet page.

### 🎂 Birthday Page

What began as a simple HTML/CSS surprise gift became an interactive, styled 11ty site with animations and hover effects. Codex helped me layer in polish I wouldn’t have managed on my own.

### 🔐 Encryption Toolkit

To keep the birthday content semi-private, I built an encryption/decryption setup — Node.js for encrypting, and a browser Q\&A for decrypting. Codex handled the boilerplate and made security approachable.

(*I’ll include screenshots alongside these to show the transformations.*)

## What I Learned

* Sketches and vague descriptions are enough to get started. Codex fills in structure fast.
* The model thrives at tedious, mechanical edits, freeing me to focus on design and flow.
* I don’t need deep CSS knowledge to end up with sites that look modern and clean.
* Pair-programming with an AI feels less like delegating and more like collaborating.

## Closing Thoughts

These projects may have been small in scope, but the process of building them with GPT-5 Codex was eye-opening. Instead of grinding through details, I got to enjoy the creative, high-level side of making things. And that’s the part that makes me believe: this style of programming isn’t just convenient — it’s the future.
