Building small websites with GPT-5 Codex turned out to be less about typing code and more about collaboration. From crude sketches to polished sites, the model took on the heavy lifting while I guided direction and design.

Along the way I discovered both the joy of fast iteration and the limits of relying on an AI partner. These projects became less about the sites themselves and more about exploring a new style of programming — conversational, creative, and sometimes flawed, but always eye-opening.

## Introduction

I’ve been experimenting with GPT-5 Codex to build small, single-page websites. These projects might seem trivial at first glance, but they became a testing ground for a new way of working with code. What surprised me wasn’t just the results, but how the process itself felt — fast, collaborative, and occasionally frustrating in ways that taught me as much as the successes did.

## Why Small Projects?

I like building tiny, focused projects — little experiments that can be finished in a weekend. They’re quick, they’re playful, and they give me something tangible to share. They’re also forgiving: if something doesn’t work, it’s easy to pivot or start again. That’s part of what makes them a great fit for experimenting with Codex, since the stakes are low and the lessons transfer to bigger projects where the caveats matter more.

## The Workflow: Conversational and Iterative

The process felt more like a conversation than traditional coding. I’d sketch a rough idea in Apple Notes, hand it over, and Codex would spin up a working site in minutes. Then we’d go back and forth: I’d highlight gaps, it would adjust, and we’d iterate. What struck me wasn’t just the speed, but how I could stay in the role of planner and designer while Codex handled the details. That said, the back-and-forth isn’t always perfect — sometimes both of us get stuck, which ties into the caveats I’ll cover later.

## Handling Tedious Changes

One of the best moments was asking Codex to transform my private “lost pet” site (originally about my cat, Luna) into a more general “lost & found pet” site. Normally, renaming everything, stripping private info, and making it public-ready is a slog. Codex did 95% of that work in one sweep, leaving me to fine-tune only the last little bits.

## Project Showcase

### 🐾 Lost & Found Pet Website

Started as a personal tool for my own cat, Luna. With Codex’s help, it quickly became a polished, shareable template for anyone who needs a lost pet page. My role was sketching the structure and clarifying how details should be presented, while Codex handled renaming and layout.

### 🎂 Birthday Page

What began as a simple HTML/CSS surprise gift became an interactive, styled 11ty site with animations and hover effects. I provided the concept and nudged the creative direction; Codex generated the styling and made the site feel polished.

### 🔐 Encryption Toolkit

To keep the birthday content semi-private, I built an encryption/decryption setup — Node.js for encrypting, and a browser Q\&A for decrypting. I set the goals and requirements, while Codex wrote most of the boilerplate and ensured the flow was secure but simple.

(*I’ll include screenshots alongside these to show the transformations.*)

## What I Learned

These are some of the key takeaways I noticed when things went smoothly. They don’t capture every situation — and as I’ll explain in the next section, there are caveats and limits to be aware of — but they highlight where Codex really shines:

* Sketches and vague descriptions are enough to get started. Codex fills in structure fast.
* The model thrives at tedious, mechanical edits, freeing me to focus on design and flow.
* I don’t need deep CSS knowledge to end up with sites that look modern and clean.
* Pair-programming with an AI feels less like delegating and more like collaborating.

## Challenges and Caveats

As smooth as the process felt, there are limits and drawbacks worth noting:

* **Knowledge gaps**: If you don’t know what you’re doing, Codex can help, but it may not always be the best or most reliable solution.
* **Shared blind spots**: Sometimes neither you nor the AI knows the best answer, and you can get stuck chasing dead ends.
* **Solution quality**: Spending a lot of time making something “work” doesn’t guarantee it’s the right or optimal solution for the problem.
* **Lack of pushback**: Codex will happily refine a flawed approach without pointing out, “hey, there’s a better way.” This can mean wasted time before realizing a different direction is needed.

## Closing Thoughts

These projects may have been small in scope, but the process of building them with GPT-5 Codex was eye-opening. Instead of grinding through details, I got to enjoy the creative, high-level side of making things. Still, it’s clear that this style of programming requires human judgment to steer in the right direction and avoid the pitfalls I mentioned earlier. For me, that balance of speed, creativity, and critical oversight is what makes me believe this conversational approach isn’t just convenient — it’s a glimpse of the future.
