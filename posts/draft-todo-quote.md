excerpt: |
  Quick dev-only check to make sure blockquotes with TODO get a high-contrast treatment.
---

## TODO quote check

> TODO: This blockquote should render with a strong, high-contrast background during dev builds.
> The styling should be obvious against every theme.

## Non-TODO quote check

> This quote should look normal because it does not contain the T-O-D-O keyword.

## TODO in longer blockquote

> We still have a TODO to update the screenshots before release.
> Keep this quote highlighted so it is hard to miss.
