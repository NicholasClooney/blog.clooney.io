  Checking whether quotes ("), ampersands (&), and angle brackets (< >) stay readable inside our social previews.

Every generator needs a stress test: `"double quotes"`, `'single quotes'`, percent signs (50%), hashes (#testing), and brackets like `<angle>` and `&` ampersands should all render as literal symbols.

Once this publishes, confirm the OG card shows the raw characters without `&amp;` noise.
