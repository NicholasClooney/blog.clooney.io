Source for [Nicholas Clooney's blog](https://blog.nicholas.clooney.io/). I write about moving fast on personal projects, developer workflows, and the tools that make side quests fun to build.

Highlights:
- [Building My Own Subspace Builder](https://blog.nicholas.clooney.io/posts/building-my-own-subspace-builder/) — shipping a custom Eleventy + Tachyons setup for rapid iterations.
- [Building with GPT-5 Codex: My Experience](https://blog.nicholas.clooney.io/posts/building-with-gpt-5-codex-my-experience/) — pairing with AI to accelerate creative coding.
- [Responsive Images with Eleventy Img](https://blog.nicholas.clooney.io/posts/responsive-images-eleventy-img/) — keeping the site fast without sacrificing visuals.
- [SSH from iPhone to Mac](https://blog.nicholas.clooney.io/posts/ssh-from-iPhone-to-Mac/) — remote dev experiments from anywhere.
