      Hi, I’m Nicholas Clooney, a seasoned engineer who loves building thoughtful,
      well-crafted software. For me, great software feels alive: clear in purpose, elegant in design,
      and reliable in every detail. I enjoy shaping systems that not only work well, but feel right,
      from the smallest UI polish to the architecture that holds everything together.
    - >
      When I’m not coding, I enjoy working with my hands, woodworking, shaping small projects from raw materials, and finding the same
      quiet satisfaction in physical craft that I do in code. I also love exploring the city, playing strategy and roguelike games, and
      spending time with my cat, Princess Luna, who keeps things interesting every day.
    - >
      This site is a mix of notes, projects, and reflections, part digital garden, part personal logbook, where I share what I’ve learned,
      built, or simply found meaningful.

      If you’re curious about collaboration, have a question about one of my posts, or just want to say hi, I always enjoy trading notes.

      This <a class="link dim underline" href="https://github.com/TheClooneyCollection/11ty-subspace-builder">🖖 "Subspace Module"</a> runs on
      <a class="link dim underline" href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, stitched together with
      a handful of custom shortcodes, Markdown enhancements, and a playground of color themes. The layout uses a light
      layer of <a class="link dim underline" href="https://tachyons.io/">Tachyons</a> utility classes so I can experiment quickly without
      reinventing a design system each time inspiration strikes.

      Every post is written in Markdown, linted by scripts in the repository, and published through an automated build
      that also generates social images. I keep analytics lightweight and transparent; you can inspect the configuration
      in the open-source repo anytime.

      Highlight snippets like <code class="fw6 ph2 pv1 br2 bg-washed-blue dark-blue">eleventy.config.js</code>,
      custom collections, and theme previews are continually evolving. If you spot something that could be improved,
      feel free to open an issue or drop me a note.
